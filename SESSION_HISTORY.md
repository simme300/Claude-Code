**Date**: August 17, 2025
**Git Commit**: `a1de828 - Optimize dashboard layout for better viewport fit`

- "We are now going to work on styling the homepage. The homepage should be a dashboard displaying information like: User information: Name, age, weight, gender, Goals: display the goals that are set, Calories: weekly daily, monthly, Workouts: total workouts this year, monthly, weekly. There should also be a way of tracking the current state of the goal vs the actualy goal."

- "remove the add workout and add meal button from the homepage, but keep it in the navigation bar"
- "the dashboard container still takes up to much space. Set it to use 100% of the width and align the header text above it align in the center of the screen with a slightly less margin to the top element(navbar).
